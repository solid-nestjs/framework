## SOLID Principles Alignment

Please confirm that your changes align with SOLID principles:

- [ ] Single Responsibility: Changes have a single, well-defined responsibility
- [ ] Open/Closed: New functionality extends rather than modifies existing code where appropriate
- [ ] Liskov Substitution: Subclasses remain substitutable for their base classes
- [ ] Interface Segregation: Interfaces are client-specific rather than general-purpose
- [ ] Dependency Inversion: Code depends on abstractions, not concrete implementations
