# @nestjz/typeorm-crud

A powerful and flexible TypeORM CRUD utilities package for NestJS applications that provides mixins for quick implementation of data access and CRUD operations.

## Features

- üöÄ Easy-to-use mixins for CRUD operations
- üîç Advanced query building with filtering, pagination and sorting
- üîí Transaction support
- üìù Comprehensive type safety
- üéØ Built-in OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
- üîÑ Relation handling and extended queries
- üõ°Ô∏è Input validation using class-validator
- üì¶ Clean architecture with separation of concerns

## Installation

```bash
npm install @nestjz/typeorm-crud
```

## Usage

### Creating a CRUD Service

```typescript
import { CrudServiceFrom, CrudServiceStructure } from '@nestjz/typeorm-crud';

// Define your service structure
export const serviceStructure = CrudServiceStructure({
  entityType: YourEntity,
  createInputType: CreateDto,
  updateInputType: UpdateDto
});

// Create the service
export class YourService extends CrudServiceFrom(serviceStructure) {
  // Add custom methods here
}
```

### Creating a CRUD Controller

```typescript
import { CrudControllerFrom, CrudControllerStructure } from '@nestjz/typeorm-crud';
import { serviceStructure, YourService } from './your.service'

// Define your controller structure
const controllerStructure = CrudControllerStructure({
  ..serviceStructure,
  serviceType: YourService,
});

export class YourController extends CrudControllerFrom(controllerStructure) {
  // Add custom endpoints here
}
```

## Query Features

### Filtering

The package supports advanced filtering operations:

- Equality: `_eq`, `_neq`
- Comparison: `_gt`, `_gte`, `_lt`, `_lte`
- Lists: `_in`
- Ranges: `_between`, `_notbetween`
- Text search: `_contains`, `_startswith`, `_endswith`
- Pattern matching: `_like`, `_notlike`

### Pagination

```typescript
{
  pagination: {
    page: 1,
    pageSize: 10
    // or
    skip: 0,
    take: 10
  }
}
```

### Sorting

```typescript
{
  orderBy: [
    { field: "ASC" },
    { anotherField: "DESC" }
  ]
}
```

## Transactions

Use the `@Transactional()` decorator to wrap operations in a transaction:

```typescript
@Transactional()
async serviceMethod() {
  // Operations will be executed in a transaction
}
```

## Documentation

The package automatically generates OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for your endpoints using `@ApiResponses()` decorator.

## Roadmap

### Current Progress
- [x] Basic CRUD operations implementation
- [x] Filtering capabilities
- [x] Basic sorting functionality
- [x] Basic pagination support
- [x] OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation
- [x] Input validation
- [x] Basic relation handling

### [0.2.0] - Enhanced Data Retrieval
- [x] Entity Id Type automatic detection.
  - currently If the IdType is not specified it's taken as int by default, it should be inferred by the EntityType.
  - supporting IdType inference means that it also should be a mapper that resolves what pipeTransform must be used for the controller retrieval of the PK from the query.
- [x] Transaction support
  - [x] Implement "runInTransaction" function
  - [x] Implemente "Transactional" decorator for services
  - [x] Allow to specify isolationLevel for transaction. (as seen in https://github.com/Aliheym/typeorm-transactional?tab=readme-ov-file#isolation-levels)
- [x] Enhanced pagination
  - [x] Return both data and pagination metadata in single response
  - [x] Fix pagination calculations for relations with one-to-many/many-to-many cardinality
- [x] Advanced relation handling
  - [x] Enable/disable specific relations at service level
  - [x] Allow relation specification using typeorm's FindOptionsRelations<T>
  - [x] Optimize relation loading performance

### [0.3.0] - Architecture & GraphQL Support
- [x] configure this project as a monorepo
- [x] Architecture enhancements
  - Decouple data layer from presentation layer
  - Create separate package for REST utilities (@nestjz/rest)
  - Create separate package for TypeORM utilities (@nestjz/typeorm)
- [ ] Configurable relation loading through request parameters
- [ ] Allow to specify transaction propagation option (as seen in https://github.com/Aliheym/typeorm-transactional?tab=readme-ov-file#transaction-propagation)
- [ ] GraphQL support
  - Create GraphQL-specific package (@nestjz/graphql)
  - GraphQL-optimized resolvers
  - GraphQL-specific decorators
- [ ] Custom operations support in the ControllerStructure
  - Allow defining custom operations in controllers
  - Support for custom routes and methods
  - Enable operation-specific validation and transformation
  - Provide decorators for operation configuration
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation
- [ ] Implement bulk operations
- [ ] support soft-deleted records recovery.
- [ ] Query optimization improvements
  - Query caching options
