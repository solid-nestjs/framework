### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report:

1. You will receive an acknowledgment of your report within 48 hours.
2. We will investigate and determine the potential impact and whether it is actually a vulnerability.
3. We will work on a fix and test it.
4. Once a fix is ready, we will release a security update.

### Disclosure Policy
