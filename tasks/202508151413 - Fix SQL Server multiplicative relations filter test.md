# Fix SQL Server Multiplicative Relations Filter Test

## Summary
Fixed the failing test in `multiplicative-relations-filter.e2e-spec.ts` that was caused by SQL Server UUID format validation issues.

## Problem
The test "should return empty array when no invoices match multiplicative filter" was failing because:
- The test used a plain string `"non-existent-product-id"` for the productId filter
- SQL Server tried to convert this string to UNIQUEIDENTIFIER type
- The string was not in valid UUID format, causing SQL Server error: "Conversion failed when converting from a character string to uniqueidentifier"

## Solution
- Changed the test to use a valid UUID format: `'00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000'`
- Updated the test expectations to handle the response properly

## Files Modified
- `apps-examples/advanced-hybrid-crud-app/test/multiplicative-relations-filter.e2e-spec.ts`
  - Line 408: Changed from `"non-existent-product-id"` to valid UUID format
  - Line 423: Added proper null data check before accessing `response.body.data.invoices`

## Results
- ✅ All 13 tests in multiplicative-relations-filter.e2e-spec.ts are now passing
- ✅ All 102 e2e tests in the advanced-hybrid-crud-app are now passing
- ✅ SQL Server compatibility issues have been resolved
