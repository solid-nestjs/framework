# SQL Server Support Feature

## Overview
Add SQL Server database support to the advanced-hybrid-crud-app with environment-based configuration, Docker Compose setup, and E2E test compatibility.

## Scope
- Support both SQLite and SQL Server databases through environment variables
- Docker Compose setup for SQL Server development environment
- E2E tests compatible with both database types
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing SQLite setup

## Functional Requirements

### 1. Database Support
- **SQLite**: Default for development, lightweight and file-based
- **SQL Server**: Production-ready, enterprise database support
- Seamless switching between databases via environment variables
- Compatible entity definitions for both databases

### 2. Configuration Management
- Environment-based database configuration
- Support for different environments (development, production, test)
- Secure credential management through environment variables
- Configuration validation at startup

### 3. Docker Infrastructure
- SQL Server 2022 container setup
- Persistent volume for data storage
- Health checks for container readiness
- Network configuration for application connectivity

### 4. Testing Support
- E2E tests runnable on both SQLite and SQL Server
- In-memory SQLite for fast test execution
- SQL Server testing with Docker container
- Test data isolation and cleanup

## Technical Implementation

### Database Configuration Factory
- Dynamic TypeORM configuration based on DB_TYPE
- Connection pooling for SQL Server
- Retry logic for database connectivity
- Proper error handling and logging

### Entity Compatibility
- Column type mapping for both databases
- Decimal precision handling
- Date/time format compatibility
- Index and constraint compatibility

### Docker Compose Services
- SQL Server with SA password configuration
- Volume mounting for data persistence
- Port exposure and network setup
- Container health monitoring
